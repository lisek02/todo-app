# TODO APP
## About the application

This is a simple todo list. While developing some assumptions were made:
- there's no backend - all the data is synchronized between Redux and Localstorage
- id for each todo item is generated based on Javascript Date.now() function
- this application should work on any modern browser, tested on Chrome v74 on desktop and mobile
